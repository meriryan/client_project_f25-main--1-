   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

   This project was developed by Meri McGinnis, with all visual design concepts, 
   layout structures, and creative direction originating entirely from my own ideas.

   During the development process, I used both Claude AI (Anthropic) and 
   ChatGPT (OpenAI’s GPT-5) as collaborative tools to assist with learning, 
   technical refinement, and content development.

   Claude AI assisted with:
   - Correcting formatting and indentation issues
   - Brainstorming and refining design concepts
   - Exploring CSS features such as gradients and card layouts
   - Creating and improving code comments for readability

   ChatGPT assisted with:
   - Providing explanations and inline comments to clarify code structure
   - Demonstrating how CSS Grid and bento layouts function, including 
     responsive column spans and spacing
   - Offering JavaScript ideas for interactivity and accessibility, which I 
     customized and implemented independently
   - Suggesting formatting improvements to enhance accessibility, 
     consistency, and overall presentation
   - Assisting with writing and editing on-page text and copy to ensure 
     clarity, tone, and alignment with the project’s purpose
   - Acting as a learning companion while troubleshooting and refining 
     components throughout the design process

   All design decisions, written content, and final implementations were 
   created, reviewed, and approved by me for this project.
